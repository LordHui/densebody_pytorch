### Update Notes
- Code reformating complete! Please refer to `data_utils/UV_map_generator.py` for more details.
- Thanks [Raj Advani](https://github.com/radvani) for providing new hand crafted UV maps!
- For those who already forked my project, the original code is now temporarily hosted in the `legacy` branch, and will be removed after the code reformatting is complete.

### Prerequisites
```
Ubuntu 18.04
CUDA 9.0
Python 3.6
PyTorch 1.0.0
chumpy (For converting SMPL model to basic numpy arrays)
spacepy, h5py (For processing Human36m cdf annotations)
```

(Optional) Install [torch-batched-svd](https://github.com/KinglittleQ/torch-batch-svd) for speedup (Only tested under Ubuntu system).


### TODO List
- [x] Creating ground truth UV position maps for Human36m dataset.
    - [x] [20190329]() Finish UV data processing.
    - [x] [20190331]() Align SMPL mesh with input image.
    - [x] [20190404]() Data washing: Image resize to 256*256 and 2D annotation compensation.
    - [x] [20190411]() Generate and save UV position map.
        - [x] [radvani](https://github.com/radvani) Hand parsed new 3D UV data
        - [x] Validity checked with minor artifacts (see results below)
        - [x] Making UV_map generation module a separate class.
    - [ ] [Proceeding] Prepare ground truth UV maps for washed dataset.
    
- [ ] Finish baseline model training
    - [ ] Testing with several new loss functions.
    - [ ] Testing with different networks.
- [ ] Report 3D reconstruction results.
    - [ ] Setup evaluation protocal and MPJPE-PA metrics.


### Current Progress
Finish UV texture map processing. Here's the result:

Align SMPL meshes with input images. Here are some results:

Reconstruct human mesh through resampling. Here are some results. Currently we simply use the nearest neighbor resampling to retrieve the  3D coordinates of mesh vertices, thus lead to some "thorn" like artifacts when the corresponding UV coord is outside the colored region. This could be resolved by dialating the UV map for 1-2 pixels before resampling.
