### Update Notes
- SMPL official UV map is now supported! Please checkout [`PREPS.md`](PREPS.md) for details.
- Code reformating complete! Please refer to `data_utils/UV_map_generator.py` for more details.
- Thanks [Raj Advani](https://github.com/radvani) for providing new hand crafted UV maps!

### Training Guidelines
Please follow the instructions [`PREPS.md`](PREPS.md) to prepare your training dataset and UV maps. Then run `train.sh` or `nohup_train.sh` to begin training. 

### Customizations

To train with your own UV map, checkout [`UV_MAPS.md`](UV_MAPS.md) for detailed instructions.

To explore different network architectures, checkout [`NETWORKS.md`](NETWORKS.md) for detailed instructions.

### TODO List
- [x] Creating ground truth UV position maps for Human36m dataset.
    - [x] [20190329]() Finish UV data processing.
    - [x] [20190331]() Align SMPL mesh with input image.

    - [x] [20190411]() Generate and save UV position map.
        - [x] [radvani](https://github.com/radvani) Hand parsed new 3D UV data
        - [x] Validity checked with minor artifacts (see results below)
        - [x] Making UV_map generation module a separate class.
    - [x] [20190413]() Prepare ground truth UV maps for washed dataset.
    - [x] [20190417]() SMPL official UV map supported!
    
- [x] Prepare baseline model training
    - [x] [20190414]() Network design, configs, trainer and dataloader
